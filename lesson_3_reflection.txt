Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping your work local?

A: When I feel that I can share my work publicly with everyone, I can use a remote repository to push it to the public server.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Sometimes we might be working on our new feature and we wouldnt want any other thing happening on the public repository affect our feature. If that were to happen, we would encounter unexpected bugs. So after completing our feature, we can pull the changes and see if we need to make necessary adjustments. That way things are more organized and under the control of individual programmers.
