Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: Staging area is the middle ground between the working directory (the one in the computer) and the repository. To add files to the directory we first add the files to the staging area and after all that has been done, we finally upload the whole thing to the repository.
